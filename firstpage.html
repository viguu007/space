		<h2> The Hidden Wonders of Space </h2> 
		<p>
 Man has always looked at the stars, and wondered about the treasures it hid. From the ancient Greeks and Egyptians to the present generation, we are all equally 
 awed by the universe, and its intricate mysteries.We have always aimed for the stars, when it comes to exploration. And even after accomplishing astonishing feats 
 like sending man to moon, space probes like Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 that has travelled far beyond our solar system,much of the universe is clearly a secret waiting 
 to be unravelled.

 Outer space is the expanse that exists beyond Earth and between celestial bodies. Outer space is not completely empty—it is a hard vacuum containing a low density 
 of particles, predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium, as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays. The baseline 
 temperature of outer space, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, is 2.7 kelvins (−270.45 °C; −454.81 °F). The plasma between galaxies accounts 
 for about half of the baryonic matter in the universe; it has a number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a temperature of millions of
 kelvins. Local concentrations of matter have condensed into stars and galaxies. Studies indicate that 90% of the mass in most galaxies is in an unknown form, 
 called dark matter, which interacts with other matter through gravitational but not electromagnetic forces. Observations suggest that the majority of the 
 mass-energy in the observable universe is dark energy, a type of vacuum energy that is poorly understood. Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the 
 universe, but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space.
