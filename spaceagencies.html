 As of 2018, 72 different government space agencies are in existence; 14 of those have launch capability. Six government space agencies—the China National Space 
 Administration (CNSA), the European Space Agency (ESA), the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the National 
 Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Russian Federal Space Agency (RFSA or Roscosmos)—have full launch capabilities; these include the ability to 
 launch and recover multiple satellites, deploy cryogenic rocket engines and operate space probes.
 
 Let's learn some more about the space agencies that have full launch capabilities:

 The Indian Space Research Organisation(ISRO) is the national space agency of the Republic of India, headquartered in Bengaluru. It operates under Department 
 of Space (DOS) which is directly overseen by the prime minister of India while chairman of ISRO acts as executive of DOS as well. ISRO is the primary agency 
 in India to perform tasks related to space based applications, space exploration and development of related technologies.It is one of six government space 
 agencies in the world which possess full launch capabilities, deploy cryogenic engines, launch extraterrestrial missions and operate large fleets of artificial 
 satellites.

 NASA was established in 1958, succeeding the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). The new agency was to have a distinctly civilian orientation, 
 encouraging peaceful applications in space science.Since its establishment, most US space exploration efforts have been led by NASA, including the 
 Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space Shuttle. NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the 
 development of the Orion spacecraft, the Space Launch System, and Commercial Crew vehicles. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program, 
 which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for uncrewed NASA launches.

		The Soviet space program was mainly based on the human spaceflight program and the development of the expendable launch vehicles, 
		which had been split between many design bureaux competing against each other. Over its 60 years of history, 
		the Soviet space program was responsible for a number of major firsts in human spaceflight, including the first intercontinental 
		ballistic missile (R-7), first satellite (Sputnik 1), first animal in Earth orbit (the dog Laika on Sputnik 2), 
		first human in space and Earth orbit (Yuri Gagarin on Vostok 1), first woman in space and Earth orbit (Valentina Tereshkova on Vostok 6), 
		first spacewalk (Alexei Leonov on Voskhod 2), first Moon impact (Luna 2), first image of the far side of the Moon (Luna 3) and uncrewed 
		lunar soft landing (Luna 9), first space rover (Lunokhod 1), first sample of lunar soil automatically extracted and brought to Earth (Luna 16), 
		and first space station (Salyut 1). Further notable records included the first interplanetary probes: Venera 1 and Mars 1 to fly by Venus and Mars, 
		respectively, Venera 3 and Mars 2 to impact the respective planet surface, and Venera 7 and Mars 3 to make soft landings on these planets.
		<br>With the dissolution of the Soviet Union,Russia created an aerospace agency called Rosaviakosmos, which is now a space agency called Roscosmos.
